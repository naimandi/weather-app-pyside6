# Weather App (PySide6)

A simple desktop GUI application that retrieves and displays current
weather information for a given location using the OpenWeather API.

## Author and Context

This project was originally authored in 2023 as a learning exercise
to practice Python GUI development, API integration, and basic
software engineering principles. It has since been lightly refactored
to follow better practices (e.g., environment variables for API keys, documentation).

## Features

- Desktop GUI built with PySide6
- User input for location
- Temperature unit selection (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin)
- Displays weather description, temperature, humidity, and wind speed
- Secure API key handling via environment variables


## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- PySide6 (Qt for Python)
- OpenWeather API
- Requests library
